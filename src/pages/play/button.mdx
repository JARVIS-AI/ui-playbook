## Functionality

As far as functionality goes, you get a lot of stuff for free by using the native `<button>` element.

### Hover state

Indicates that the button is interactive when hovered with the mouse.

### Active state

Indicates that the button is pressed down.

### Focus state

Indicates that the focus in the document is currently on the button.

> For the sake of aesthetics, it can be tempting to remove default browser focus styles with `outline: 0;` <br /><br />
> Do not do this before adding your own custom focus styles!

### Disabled state

Indicates that the button is not interactive.

If necessary, used in combination with a <Link href="/play/tooltip">Tooltip</Link> to provide a brief explanation on hover.

### Loading state

Indicates that the action taken via the button is asynchronous and will respond in a given amount of time.

Visually, it is common that a spinner is shown inside the button.
Make sure that the button itself is not expanding in width or height while in this state.

### Responsive

Buttons should adapt to mobile devices by expanding in height to a minimum of 48px.
Optionally, buttons on mobile can also become block level full width elements.
