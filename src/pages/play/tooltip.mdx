# Tooltip

Tooltip is a non-interactive overlay that briefly explains the function of the trigger element.

<Icon icon="tooltip" />

## Functionality

- Displayed when the trigger element is hovered by the mouse or when it receives keyboard focus.
- Focus remains on the trigger element while the tooltip is displayed.
- Dismissed with the `Escape` key or by a blur/mouseleave event.

## Best practices

- Do not use a tooltip for information vital to task completion. The action of the element it is attached to should make sense on its own.
- Make sure to provide a short and succinct label for the tooltip.
- Avoid interactive content such as buttons and links inside the tooltip. As an alternative, consider Popover.
- Displaying the tooltip too quickly on mouseover can result in accidental activations and creates a jarring user experience.
It is advisable to add a short delay (~100ms) before displaying it.
- Once a tooltip is visible, interaction with any other tooltip should display immediately without the delay.
- The tooltip can have preferred positioning options, but should adjust itself dynamically based on collisions and available space.

## Implementation

- To avoid parent containers possibly clipping the tooltip and its content, render the tooltip outside the DOM hierarchy of its parent component.
For React, a common mechanism for is a [Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html)
- By default, [disabled elements like `<button>` do not trigger mouse events.](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/events-and-disabled-form-fields/)
This is an unfortunate misinterpretation of the spec by the browsers. As a workaround, we recommend using [Pointer Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events)
(which follow the spec more closely) for disabled trigger elements.
- You may want to wrap

## Examples

A few tooltip implementation examples from various design systems:

### [Modulz â€” Radix (React)](https://radix.modulz.app/docs/tooltip/)

<Tooltip label="You do not have permission to delete this user." side="top" align="center">
  <span style={{display: 'inline-block'}}>
    <Button size={1} disabled>Delete user</Button>
  </span>
</Tooltip>
