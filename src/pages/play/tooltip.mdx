# Tooltip

Tooltip is a non-interactive overlay that briefly explains the function of the trigger element.

<Icon icon="tooltip" />

## Functionality

- Displayed when the trigger element is hovered by the mouse or when it receives keyboard focus.
- Focus remains on the trigger element while the tooltip is displayed.
- Dismissed with the `Escape` key or by a blur/mouseleave event.

## Best practices

- Do not use a tooltip for information vital to task completion. The action of the element it isattached to should make sense on its own.
- Make sure to provide a short and succinct label for the tooltip.
- Avoid interactive content such as buttons and links inside the tooltip. As an alternative, consider Popover.
- Displaying the tooltip too quickly on mouseover can result in accidental activations and creates a jarring user experience.
It is advisable to add a short delay (~100ms) before displaying it.
- Once a tooltip is visible, interaction with any other tooltip should display immediately without the delay.
- The tooltip can have preferred positioning options, but should adjust itself dynamically based on collisions and available space.

## Implementation

- To avoid parent containers possibly clipping the tooltip, it is advisable to render the tooltip in a React Portal with fixed positioning.
- By default, disabled elements like `<button>` do not trigger mouse events. This is an unfortunate misinterpretation of the spec by the browsers.
As a workaround, we recommend using [Pointer Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) (which follow the spec more closely)
for disabled trigger elements.
