## New component proposals

If you believe that there's a component missing from UI Playbook, feel free to submit a proposal for a new one.
Don't worry if the proposal isn't perfect â€” we can work out the details in collaboration! The idea is to submit a draft that could be iterated upon.

You can do so by submitting a new issue and following the issue template, which aims to cover the following key points:

- Component name, with visual, and concise description
- Functionality (describe how the component should behave)
- Best practices (cover pitfalls, intricacies or any other non-obvious things to keep in mind)
- Implementation (a bit more technical than the previous chapters, possibly get into framework-specific nuances)
- Examples (render a few well implemented examples of the component from various design systems)
- Accessibility (cover relevant accessibility requirements and links to WAI-ARIA docs for the component design pattern, if applicable)
- Resources (any resources used to put the play together)


## Development

Install the dependencies:

`yarn` or `npm install`

Run locally:

`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
